# water-management-report-webpage
Lightweight React application for a local water maintenance company who wanted a better way for their employees to create their required monthly forms.

This was a project where I put an emphasis on speed to see how much I could complete in under 12 hours. While the majority was completed in that time frame, the uploading/downloading of data was something I came back and added the next morning.

Due to the emphasis on speed, there are a lot of graphical design aspects I'd like to rework, but it met their needs and more and was something I was merely doing as a favor to them free of charge. 

The actual layout itself is rather unique to their needs, so not something I imagine people could use as is. If there are any blank spots where it seems data should have been, this was because I removed any identifying numbers/details that would hint at their company or private information.

Expected paper size is 8.5 x 11
